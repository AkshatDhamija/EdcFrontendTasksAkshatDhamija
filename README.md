#portfolio-website

I completed all 5 stages in the front end task. Making an html website first then integrating it with bootstrap css to design it better and make it user friendly. Then I made the website responsive with links and design. Used JS to include theme toggling and Caraousel for projects. I also added animations at last but it is not included in the screenshots below-
